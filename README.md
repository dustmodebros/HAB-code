# HAB-code
Upload of the High-Altitude-Balloon code from the 2022 Harrodian HAB club for posterity

This repository contains the code that was run on the Arduino that was sent up to 100,000ft (~30,000m) in altitude, collected atmospheric and position (GPS) data, and transmitted said data live back to a base station. The position data was then used to track the position of the balloon in flight.

Also included in the repository is the saved data that was collected. You can parse and analyse this data using the included parser.py program.

More things will be added to this repo when I get around to it :P
