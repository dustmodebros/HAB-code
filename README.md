# HAB-code
Upload of the High-Altitude-Balloon code from the 2022 Harrodian HAB club for posterity

This repository contains the code that was run on the Arduino that was sent up to 100,000ft (~30,000m) in altitude, collected atmospheric and position (GPS) data, and transmitted said data live back to a base station.
